# Predicting Flight Delays Using Machine Learning

**Problem Statement:**

Flight delays are a major challenge in the aviation industry, leading to passenger inconvenience, financial losses, and operational inefficiencies for airlines and airports. Our project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict flight delays by leveraging historical flight records, aircraft specifications, weather conditions, carrier performance, route details, and airport congestion metrics.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- A machine learning model capable of accurately predicting flight delays based on flight parameters.
- A REST API for real-time delay predictions, providing airlines with actionable insights.
- A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, data processing steps, model performance, and evaluation metrics.
- Recommendations for optimizing airline scheduling and resource management based on predictive insights.
